    * Base class for object models with a single body.
    * <p>
    * This class offers all the basic functionality to manage
    * models composed of a single body. These models, while having
    * only a single body, can have multiple associated shapes.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * Single-body objects are often passive objects such as boxes and
    * cylinders, and simple robots with no moving parts, such as the
    * e-puck.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * To use this class, simply create a class that inherits from it.
    * The default implementations for Reset(), MoveTo(), etc. should
    * be already OK for your needs.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * In the constructor of your class, be sure to call the method SetBody()
    * when you have created the body and associated the shapes to it. If this
    * method is not called, the default implementations will have segfaults.
    * </p>
    * <p>
    * This class retains ownership for the body and shapes you created once
    * you call SetBody(). In other words, you don't need to free these objects
    * because ~CDynamics3DSingleBodyObjectModel() does it for you.
    * </p>
